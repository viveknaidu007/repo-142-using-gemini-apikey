To create a list, we simply enclose our items in square brackets and separate them by commas. We can access individual items in the list using their index, which starts at zero. For example, to access the first item in the list, we would use zero index. We can also do negative indexing, which starts from minus one, then minus two, and goes on. Negative indexing basically means to start from the end and go towards the start of the list.\n",
    "Now let's talk about some built-in methods for lists in Python. To determine how many items a list has, we can use the len method, which will return the length of the list. We can add an item to the end of the list with the append method. We can also insert an item at the specified index with the insert method. To remove a specified item from the list, we can use the remove method. To remove an item from a specified index, we can use the pop method with the index, which, if not specified, will remove the last item in the list. The sort method sorts the list alphanumerically in ascending order. We can also reverse the order by specifying reverse=True in the method. We can also join two lists by simply using the plus operator. We can loop through a list by using the for loop\"\"\"\n",
